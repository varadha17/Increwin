POINTS TO CONSIDER: 

Create a new Java (Maven, gradle), C#(.NET core/framework) project with an appropriate test framework like Nunit, TestNG, cucumber etc., 

1. Automate tests in Chrome browser 
2. Use parameterized data instead of hardcoded test data 
3. Use Page Object Model with Selenium as much as possible 
4. Make your functions more generic and use coding best practices as much as possible 
5. Once the test is done, please zip the entire project and send it to us
